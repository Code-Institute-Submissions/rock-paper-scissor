# Rock | Paper | Scissors | Spock | Lizard

A game based on rock paper scissors, but with a twist.

## Credits

First of all, I want to give credit where credit is due. Some of the code snippets I have in my JS code has been taken and/or modified from DevEd's channel on youtube.
I will proivde a link to the video in this readme file, accompanied with comments in the JS file.
Besides from that, I used google and stackOverFlow to find out what my code should look like.

Thanks Ed!

## Purpose of this app

To give a fun experience playing rock, paper, scissors, but with some additions.
The game features two additional (but not optional) choices called "Spock" and "Lizard", which makes it a bit harder to win than the usual rules.

## Development

The idea for this project had it's inception when I was reading through the CI assessment project ideas. I went with project example idea #1.

The first thing was to write the HTML.
it consists of two main elements ('Main Page' and 'Game'), filled with subelements.

Once I had my basic HTML structure setup, I started adding the CSS. Much trial and error here!
I wanted to have everything on one single page so I had to put a class of 'hide' on all the elements I wanted to hide while writing the stylesheet.

Once the basics of the CSS were there, I started looking into the JS part.

The JS consists of functions do hide, update, disable and change elements.
What those functions are can be found in the JS file comments.

I then started finding bugs, errors, bad practice etc. So I started refactoring some of the HTML and CSS to be more flexible and accessible when writing in JS.

Last thing I did (but should have done earlier, I admit) was to add media queries for larger/smaller computer screens, and finally iPad and phone screens.
